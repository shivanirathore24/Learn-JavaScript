Instrument Player
You have an HTML file and CSS code that represents a Drumkit Player. The HTML file contains buttons representing 
different drum sounds, and the CSS code styles the elements. Your task is to complete the JavaScript code to make 
it a working drumkit player.

Requirements:
Add a keypress event listener to all the buttons in the HTML file.
When a specific key corresponding to a button is pressed, the corresponding sound should be played.
Each button should also have a click event listener that triggers the same function as the keypress event.
The following keys and their corresponding sound URLs should be used:
Key 'w': Sound URL - https://files.codingninjas.in/tom-1-28537.mp3
Key 'a': Sound URL - https://files.codingninjas.in/tom-2-28541.mp3
Key 's': Sound URL - https://files.codingninjas.in/tom-3-28542.mp3
Key 'd': Sound URL - https://files.codingninjas.in/tom-4-28543.mp3
Key 'j': Sound URL - https://files.codingninjas.in/snare-28545.mp3
Key 'k': Sound URL - https://files.codingninjas.in/crash-28546.mp3
Key 'l': Sound URL - https://files.codingninjas.in/kick-bass-28547.mp3

Note:
You should use the Audio tag to play the sound files.
